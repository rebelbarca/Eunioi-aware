    "paragraph":"Unfortunately, sickness and personal issues as well as increased work commitments had a slight impact on this assessment. I believe our team pulled together and rallied in the face of these issues and were able to produce a great result. Most of the meetings were attended by all and all videos and minutes were watched and read by missing team members. Communication was lower outside of our meetings than the last assessment, but this could be attributed to the issues our team was facing outside of study. Most tasks were achieved by their assigned deadlines and team members were assigned to tasks that properly aligned with their strengths."
