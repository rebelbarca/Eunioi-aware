    "I live in Sydney with my wife and kids and have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. My interest in IT began when I started pulling apart computers and putting them back together again. I am a highly motivated and hardworking individual. My education in full stack web development at the University of Sydney, and self-taught knowledge and experience combined with my interest, passion and enjoyment in coding, programming, Cloud Computing and Virtualization, will enable me to learn, contribute and excel in the Web Development Industry. I enjoy working out how things work and why they function the way they do. I enjoy the programming and back-end side of things. I prefer being the person behind the scenes. I like challenging myself to prove to myself that I can accomplish anything that is thrown at me.",

    "One of my favourite hobbies is gaming. I am platform agnostic and enjoy playing on all platforms such as Xbox, custom built PC, PlayStation, and Switch (personally, I hate mobile gaming). I play a large variety of games with my favourite games currently being LOL, Rocket League, Battlefield, and Elden Rings. I have always been interested in technology and my spark began at a young age. My best memories as a child are of the times my uncle would bring over new PC parts to upgrade our family computer, and all the new games he used to spoil me with. From there my interest sparked and I became the family tech guy; every time there was an IT related issue it was my duty to fault find and fix. My lack of formal education has impeded my ability to join the tech industry until now where my sales background has allowed me to gain employment at Microsoft.",

    "I am Australian with a little Polish. I can speak a bit of German though English is my main language. Outside of study I am a barista and vivid cricket player. I have completed all schooling up to year 12. My interest in IT started when I started playing the Xbox Classic. My personal interest with IT is the way that we can fundamentally manipulate everyday appliances/software to do anything that you can think of. My interest was sparked by my father and his brother. My experience is IT is a basic understanding of the fundamentals but have delved into some more advanced things in the recent past. I chose to go to RMIT as it was recommended to me by my uncle as he was offered a place here when he went to university. I expect to further my knowledge of IT and programming during my studies as I see myself starting my own company once I have completed my studies.",

    "I live in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs with my partner and dog named Harper. I love playing video games and have always been curious about how they are made and how other technology works. When seeing with new tech, my main question is, how does that work and what “language” is it using to communicate. I enjoy playing video games with my mates when I can and love a good beer! I used to want to own and run my bar (still do) which is a gaming lounge where people could come and drink and game, play tournaments and watch E-sports events.",

    "My name is Zenithon Ho, but people call me Zen for short. Both my parents are from Hong Kong, but I was born in Australia. In my spare time, I play an online card game called Magic the Gathering: Arena, where I compete against other players whilst collecting cards. My interest in IT started when I was a very young age. The simple act of being connected to the world wide web and accessing information from our dial-up modem captivated me. Currently, I do not have much IT experience. My only knowledge of the languages are some small lessons done on websites such as freecodecamp.com and Codecademy. Through my studies at RMIT I would be expecting to learn how I would be integrating into the IT profession. Learning skills such as coding, working on projects, analysing, and solving problems from the perspective of an IT professional.",

One not so fun fact about me is that I am currently quarantining with Covid-19 (Update 24th March 2022-now out from quarantine and covid free. Yay!). I always enjoyed trying to repair things or set things up growing up. As an adult, I am fascinated with technology that now enhances our lives. I have an interest in big data. Data that can be used by programs to recommend certain decisions. Hence, you could say I have always had an interest in IT, but this has evolved with changing technology.",
