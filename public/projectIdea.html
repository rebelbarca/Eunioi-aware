                        The amount of mental health applications (MHapps) available on mobile devices has significantly increased over the years. These technology-based apps have the potential to have a crucial impact for mental health care. Current MHapps do not implement features that are optimized or improve their functionality. Developers have been reluctant in conducting or publishing trial-based experimental validation of their apps. Mobile devices are not restricted by location and usually are owned and operated by a single individual. This privacy aspect when a user engages an application allows the app to become flexible and appealing to users. Users with a high demand for autonomy are an ideal target market for utilising an MHapp. Young adults are very impatient and expect information and data to be accessed almost immediately, and technology has enabled this expectation. Being very familiar with mobile devices allows users to be comfortable with utilising self-help support materials. Apps are always accessible in any context and environment. MHapps are beneficial in being able to send reminders of ongoing goals and provide rewards which can motivate users in achieving their goals.

                        Most Australians will suffer from loneliness in their lifetimes. It was estimated that 1 in 3 Australians suffered from loneliness between 201 and 2009, with 40% of these people suffering from more than one episode. In surveys taken since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic 54% of respondents reported that they felt more isolated and lonelier since the beginning of the pandemic.

                        The survey found that the age demographic that felt lonely the most in the past week over the course of the survey were those aged between 18 and 24. This corresponds with the feeling of young people feeling more isolated and lonelier during the pandemic as young people are social animals and like to go out with friends.

                        Mental health also has a major impact on single parent families especially where it is single dad families. With 20.7% of the 1 million families in Australia being single dads. The social stereotypes that are associated with single parent families do not make it easier for single dads. There is not much information out there for single dad families as it is seen that there is at least a woman around to help. A survey conducted in 2017 by the recruitment agency Hays, 54% of men said that they were reluctant to take leave as they were scared it would damage their family financially. Another 34% said that were scared that they would be seen as less committed to their job.

                        Mobile devices have many strengths and capabilities which MHapps have yet to capitalize on. These apps have not implemented the design principles which have lead to the success of physical health and networking apps. There are self-help interventions which have implemented evidence-based guidelines that have not been developed into MHapps. These apps classify their users through diagnosis and specific disorders. This labelling process has been suggested to be harmful and stigmatising. The recommendations for the future development in MHapps are as follows:
                    </p>
                </div> 
            </div>

            <div class="row">

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                        It is not feasible to implement every recommendation into a single app. When developing MHapp projects, this list was compiled using available evidence in order to guide and inform the marketing and design aspects of the app. The interaction users have with applications are determined by marketing the same way that engagement motivation and creating hope is influenced by pretherapy expectations. Design is inclusive in the marketing of an app where a user will download and utilise an app for the purpose of relaxation if the word “relaxation” is used in the description of the app on the app store.

                        There is a high connection between anxiety and depression, with 85% of people who are affected from depression issues also shows signs of anxiety and 90% of people with symptoms of anxiety disorders suffer from depression. “In Australia, 25% of all general practice patients have comorbid depression and anxiety, whereas in Great Britain, half of all mental illness cases are mixed anxiety and depression” (Bakker, D. et al, 2016. https://mental.jmir.org). This has created an awareness for considerations to be implemented in self-help interventions. Features designed to target one disorder probably have a similar effect on other emotional disorders. These shared factors that contribute to various emotional disorders can be considered when developing MHapps which will make them more effective in relation to treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many applications have been developed for people who have been classified with being affected with a specific clinical disorder. This can be effective when implementing interventions. The accessibility of mobile devices has allowed them to be interwoven into an individual’s daily routine and the majority of these users have not been diagnosed with a clinical disorder but may suffer similar symptoms. As a result, a developer will exclude a lot of mobile device users if they target specific clinical populations. There will be an increase in willing users if the MHapp addresses preventive strategies to deal with emotional health problems before having to be diagnosed. These features would be more marketable, rigorous, and effective. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People who are seeking help in a market filled with clinical diagnosis apps can be harmful to them because they will feel labelled from an app that is assuming that they have a clinical disorder even though they might only be experiencing low-level effects. Reducing stigma and acknowledging the continuum of mental health along with the benefits of well-being promotion can increase the likelihood of a user seeking help. MHapps that take on nonclinical cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) will be able to reduce the harmful effects of labelling. CBT can be used as a tool to support individuals in coping with nonclinical psychological distress which can reduce the chance of these symptoms reaching clinical urgency. This preventative strategy can assist in preventing relapse, increase a user’s coping skill-set, and avoid developing a clinical disorder. Developers should be familiar with CBT and how they can implement features to create a CBT-based MHapp. This type of application can be used by clinical and nonclinical populations.

                        When opening the web application, the user will be presented with the landing page displaying a short gif video demonstrating how the application is utilized. The user is required to register an account to access the application. Once the user is logged in, they are directed to their profile page. Features considered for the application are a google maps page where the user can find other users of the application in their surrounding area for meet-ups or communication, an information page providing information on possible health issues related to symptoms the user may be experiencing, and an events page where the user can view upcoming social events that they may be interested in. The user can add as many events to a favourites page as they want and will stay logged in until they choose to logout.

                        Cloud Infrastructure: Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are platforms that utilize global networks of data centres for deployment and management of web applications.

                    <p>
                        Cross-Platform Capabilities: Initially you will choose a specific platform like Android, iOS, or Windows to begin creating the application but eventually you will want your app to be able to run across all platforms. Transferring the coding from one platform to another might prove to be more complicated if not anticipated.

                    <p>
                        Data Expertise: Collecting and analysing data will be an important skill to acquire to determine the effectiveness of the app and how many users the app has attracted. This is achieved through efficient databases and repositories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Security: The user’s personal information and data is important to consider when developing an app that requires user register and login functions. You want to gain the users trust by making them feel that their data is safe and will not be used for other purposes besides what the app will use it for. You need to make sure your systems are protected from outside hackers.

                        The development of MHapps has created new opportunities in improving and managing mental health issues. There are 16 recommendations that should be considered when designing future applications. CBT-based features should be implemented and adapted to prevent mental health problems by focusing on individual needs and delivering these features through simple and interactive design. To increase user engagement with the app, structures of gamification and habit formation should be used. User data should be analysed for continued development. Developers should be familiar with CBT techniques and strategies while designing these types of apps. Adopting preventative frameworks will assist in the design for nonclinical support. There are three types of intervention:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            •	Universal: Available to every user
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            •	Selective: Available to users at risk
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            •	Indicated: Available to those with preclinical symptoms
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If designed accordingly, an MHapp could adapt to any of these models starting with a universal approach as default, and then focusing on either a selective or indicated approach if the user feels that they are vulnerable to certain clinical disorders.
