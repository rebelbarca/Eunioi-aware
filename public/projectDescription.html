                        Mental health applications (MHapps) available on mobile devices have increased significantly in the past decade. Issues such as busy work schedules, relationship problems, increased isolation, and work-life balance, these are all key factors that are increasing the frequency of mental illness amongst people in our hectic world. MHapps can play a key role in the care of someone with a mental health condition. Currently, many developers are hesitant in performing or publishing experiments that are trial based, when validating their apps. In respect to privacy, the individual use of an application on their mobile phone in any location allows such an application to be appealing and flexible to users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ideal market for a Mental health app would be any users who have a high demand for autonomy, such as young adults. Young adults always wish to be online, are often very impatient and attempt to access data instantaneously. The rise of mobile technologies and apps have been a medium for these expectations, since apps are easily accessible, one just requires a mobile phone. Familiarity with mobile applications and devices has allowed users to be comfortable when engaging in self-help therapies or materials. MHapps are also beneficial in the way they can remind users of their personal goals, providing rewards which in turn will motivate users to work towards them.

                        Mental health conditions are a profoundly serious form of insidious disease. Regardless of if one is young or old, such conditions that are left unchecked can have a snowball effect, affecting a wide variety of aspects in their life. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (2018) estimated that 20% of Australians had a behavioral or mental condition, 13.1% had a condition related to anxiety and 10.4% experienced depression or feelings relating to depression (ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) 2018). Out of the 20% of Australians with a mental disorder in any given year, 11.5% had one disorder and 8.5% had two or more disorders (Black Dog Institute 2020). The 3 most common mental illnesses experienced by Australians include substance use disorders, mood disorders (i.e., depression) and anxiety. It has also been estimated that 45% of Australian adults will be affected by a form of mental illness sometime in their life (Department of Health 2019) These percentages of the Australian population accounts for people who have been actively diagnosed with having a mental health issue. However, it does not account for the portion of the population that may be experiencing symptoms but have not been diagnosed.

                        Issues such as anxiety and stress are experienced by everyone. It is not limited to someone who has a mental health condition. These feelings are common responses in situations where one may feel under pressure and will usually subside once the stimulus has passed. If one experiences anxiety or stress, they should not be labelled as having a mental health condition. The fear of being stigmatized and not seeking professional help due to financial or geographical reasons can lead to grave consequences. This app is designed for users to avoid being 'diagnosed' with a mental health issue, whilst providing ongoing support with information on their symptoms, with methods to counteract their problems without breaking the bank by seeing a professional.

                        From a user's perspective, the current market is very saturated with MHapps. Amy et al (2022) researched several MHapps on the market and ranked them on a small list based on functionality and application. The app known as 'Moodfit' was ranked the best overall. Free to download, it is an app that utilizes cognitive behavioral therapy, audio, and articles to assist in what the user is experiencing, as well as the ability to track the user's mood over time. These features are combined with strategies to help the user to modify certain negative thoughts or actions to improve the user's mood. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another application focuses on the therapy side of the mental health issue. 'Talkspace' is a paid service that connects users to mental health professionals. It grants the user the ability to speak to licensed professionals, to assist users in treating and diagnosing conditions. There is a large variety of specialists available to the user, and all conversations between the two parties are private.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An application that focuses on stress relief is 'Sanvello', which utilizes cognitive behavioral therapy methods to deal with depression and anxiety. It comes with two options, free and $8.99. Based on research, the app tracks the user's mood daily, providing them with questions to identify certain emotions and patterns within their mood. There are ongoing progress tasks that can assist the user to track their current position and future goals. There is also a community where users can participate anonymously, allowing them to share questions and advice to others who are experiencing similar symptoms.

                    <p>
                        An app that is extremely helpful for depression symptoms is'Depression CBT Self-Help Guide'. A free app only available for Android devices, it helps the user with activities and audio features, whilst offering feedback on their symptoms. From an initial questionnaire, the app will assist the user in categorizing the severity of their depression. The app also contains a plethora of information relating to mental health and is based on cognitive behavioral therapy.

                        Currently, there are large numbers of MHapps on the market. Whilst this is advantageous to a potential user looking for a wide variety of options, many of these MHapps have features that are not fine-tuned or require specific features to boost their functionality. Bakker et al. (2016) investigated many existing MHapps on the market and found that much lacked evidence from trial-based exams. Our project will aim to use machine learning, coupled with data from cognitive behavioral therapy, to provide support and information on the user's symptoms. The key differences are we operate a not-for-profit organization, and our app is designed to avoid the user being labelled as having a mental issue, whilst providing methods to counter act their issues without breaking the bank and seeing a professional.

                        The aim of our project is to create a mental health application that does not label users as being diagnosed with mental health disorders. Whilst there is a myriad of mental health apps on the market, the applications will often attempt to classify their users based on diagnosis and disorders. â€˜Labellingâ€™ the user as having a certain condition or disorder. This process of labelling is suggested to be both stigmatizing and harmful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our app will have several integrated features that will achieve this aim. The development of machine learning to create an algorithm, to predict behavioral patterns of users. This data will be correlated and linked to other users on the platform. For example: Creating an anonymous chatroom where users use their own custom names, so their identity will be hidden. Based on a questionnaire with interests and hobbies, they will be linked to another user with similar interests, with the same condition or disorder. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app would signal that there are other users in their area or vicinity with a shared condition (based on google maps). Google Maps would not give the actual addresses of users, but only a co-ordinate. This would allow users to not be hesitant when using the app, in fear of being labelled as having a mental health condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another feature that will assist in the aim is the development of a chatbot. The chatbot will use machine learning, predictive analysis and personalization based on the user's inputs. It will aim to speak to the user, offering support and information relating to their condition. This will be done in a way such that the user does not feel pressured or labelled as having a mental health condition. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whilst some of these aims are possible within our given timeframe, there are a couple of features that may not be developed in time. For example: Currently, the private chatroom requires the user to enter a custom name every single time they start chatting. This should not be necessary as the app would save the users previous details unless they intend to change it. The change would be implemented after the initial 6 weeks of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another feature that could be refined is the analysis of other users of the app on google maps, when using the chatroom feature. Currently, when the user brings up the google maps list, it shows the list of all users using the app. The list should only show the user initially, and will show other users once the user clicks 'analyze' and is linked to other users of the app. The lack of these polished features will not be detrimental to the running of the application but, will be fully fleshed out in the 10 weeks post development.

                        UX Designer: These skills are used in the development of mobile applications and most of the time are skipped due to developers enabling actions instead of satisfying the end users interaction with the app and encouraging it. The application might function as designed but clients and users pay more attention to how the application looks and interacts with them on their devices. Developers need to make sure the application is appealing to the end user.

                        Software Developer: Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are platforms that utilize global networks of data centres for deployment and management of web applications. Initially you will choose a specific platform like Android, iOS, or Windows to begin creating the application but eventually you will want your app to be able to run across all platforms. Transferring the coding from one platform to another might prove to be more complicated if not anticipated.

                        Software Developer: The user's personal information and data is important to consider when developing an app that requires user register and login functions. You want to gain the users trust by making them feel that their data is safe and will not be used for other purposes besides what the app will use it for. You need to make sure your systems are protected from outside hackers.

                        Machine Learning (ML) can be viewed as an artificial intelligence (AI) that is not specifically programmed to but utilises algorithms to use historical data allowing software applications to predict accurate new output values which can be used in decision making for enterprises for future endeavours. ML can provide trends in customer behaviour that can lead to new developments in products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ML platform wars will intensify as it continues to become an integral part of business operations and as AI becomes more practical in the enterprise environment. To produce an algorithm that can perform a task at an optimal level requires extensive training. Programming a machine that can apply context learned from one task to future, different tasks require research and techniques into deep learning and AI that will create flexible models and will lead to increasing focus in developing general applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is an interesting area of AI that could be integrated into the app and provide useful predictions and recommend innovations in self-management solutions for mental health issues, which would be particularly valuable. An events page where the user can view upcoming social events using an API call was an initial feature considered in the development of the app. This feature could still be implemented with further development. The user would then be able to add as many events to a favourites page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ML could be utilised as a tool, in order to predict user behaviours and choices. It could accomplish this by analysing their past history on which events were added to the favourites page or which articles the user found interesting and helpful or useless, identifying patterns, then recommending future events or articles according to the user preferences. However, this would require a large amount of data to be accumulated in order for the algorithm error in accuracy to be minimal. Test and training data would have to be generated and testing the accuracy of the algorithm would have to take place before this type of AI could be integrated into the app

                        Sources used to assist in the development of the chatbot recommended that IBM Watson be used to host chatbot content (Renotte 2020). The scope and limits of the chatbot was subsequently determined by the instructions. Further research revealed the limitations of the software used for the development of the chatbot (IBM Watson Assistant) (IBM 2022a, Renotte 2020). IBM Watson Assistant requires conversation data to be pre-processed (Hassan2020). IBM Watson Assistant responses are recorded as dialogue. IBM Watson Assistant also has intents programmed to allow it to identify conversation (Renotte 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This limits both the scope and type of conversations that the chatbot can have. Many other chatbots are based on a neural network (Anonymous, c2022), where the chatbot can learn beyond stored patterns. This also means that these chatbots can be trained via datasets (Debecker 2017). The version of IBM Watson Assistant used enforces additional limitations (IBM 2022b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most significant limitation is that only text-based chat is used. Many other chatbots (such as Kuki (Anonymous, c2022a)) can now be trained to recognize audio-visual material, and even play simple games. It is also possible for users to create an account so that the chatbot can 'learn' about a user and in turn have conversations based on topics. This can allow a 'relationship' to develop between the chatbot and the user (Anonymous, c2022a).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such extensive memorizing is not possible when using IBM Watson Assistant, as IBM Watson Assistant cannot learn in this way (IBM 2022a). Conversation numbers were additionally limited by budget. Additional features (including more intents) were available for purchase (IBM 2022b). However, such purchasing was beyond the budget limitations of the project. The chatbot presented will be a working prototype at best. Long term, this would be redeveloped using a methodology that is based on neural networks.

                        The tools that were required for the completion and editing of the video are OBS Studio, Powerpoints inbuilt-recorder and Adobe Premiere Pro 2022. The use of these professional tools allowed the group to make a thorough and professional video for release to the general public. OBS Studio was used as the main recording software with Powerpoints being used to display the text that is vital to our project. Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 is the professional standard for video editing and allowed us to create a professional and simplistic video for release.

                        Our testing will be completed in alpha and beta stages before being rolled out to the public. Throughout our alpha testing stage, we will be relying on our groups immediate family members to complete testing on our platform. The number we are aiming for will be 10-20 users. We will be asking that they test every aspect of our application including registering an account, logging in, using the location tools, testing the community live chat feature, and testing to ensure all article links are active and always refreshing with the latest ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once alpha testing is complete and any bugs found are rectified, we will move into the beta phase of our testing. This will include rolling it out to a larger amount of people, however it will only be extended families and friends of the creators. The number of testers we will be looking for at this stage will be between 50-100. With a larger number of users accessing the platform, it will allow us to pressure test it and ensure that any bugs that exist are found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finding bugs in testing is not a negative, it is a positive and a great way to measure success. The more bugs that are found during testing will help reduce the number of bugs found during the launch and rollout of our platform.

                        When developing features for the program, different applications were used in development. A chatbot feature is in development with react, whilst other features such as a real-time chat room, google maps feature and an API call based on users' input were developed with node.js and pushed to Heroku for deployment. The main risk comes from merging the chatbot's code into the main application's code. Currently, the application has been deployed on Heroku with no issues, but it is unknown if merging the additional code from a different application could cause the whole application to crash and become unfunctional. This will be addressed in future development, as it is uncertain if the chatbot will be completed within the allocated 4-week period.

                        Communication is a key factor in determining the success and functionality of any group project. Our group would hold weekly meetings on Sunday and Thursday for the first 2 weeks of the project. This was later changed to Monday and Wednesday due to group membersâ€™ work commitments and availability. These meetings would be held over Microsoft Teams, with one team member in charge of taking the minutes of the meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first meeting every week would be used to discuss project ideas, brainstorming which task would need to be completed for the week and ensuring everyone was on track at the time. The second meeting each week would be used as a progress check, to make sure every team member was completing their task within the given timeframe, whilst continuing to discuss tasks and roles for the development of the application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the week, team members will regularly communicate through the Microsoft Teams application, whether it be on their computer/laptop or on their phone. Communication outside of the meetings will be for questions and progress updates. On the off chance a team member is unavailable to attend the meetings, they will watch the recorded meeting on Microsoft Teams, and provide input on their current progress. If a team member does not respond to communications, other avenues of communication will be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The team has a Discord chat with the 6 members of the group, which will be used as an alternative if there is no response. After repeated messaging attempts being unsuccessful, group members who participated in the group meetings will be allocated additional tasks. If the group member who does not respond is unable to complete parts of the assessment, it will not be a detriment to the group.
