                <p>Data systems engineers can venture into any of the following industries:</p>
                <div class="list" style="font-size: 18px;">
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Primarily, a bachelor or postgraduate degree in a related information technology field (such as programming, software engineering, software development or computer science) is optimal in acquiring work as a Data systems engineer. Some workers have a Vocational Education and Training (VET) qualifications.</p>
                <p>Even though I have acquired a substantial skill-set from my degree in Mechanical Engineering and online courses.  I have yet to acquire enough knowledge and skills to become a data systems engineer. The data provided has not deterred me from pursuing this career path. The data shows an increase in job opportunities in the coming years and that there are various industries that will require the skill-set associated with data systems engineers. I hope that with the combination of my Degree in Engineering, education, along with the knowledge and certifications gained from future courses in data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will allow me to thrive and upskill myself in becoming a competent and successful Data Systems Engineer.</p>

                <h2>Oliver</h2>
                <p>After using the Burning Glass data, I would still follow through with my chosen career path of ICT service team leader. Team leaders in the ICT sector are in low demand currently but there is room for growth as the industry continues to expand and develop. Job security at first would not be secure but as the sector and industry develops job security would become very secure.</p>

                <h2>Justin</h2>
                <p>After researching the Information Technology industry, I would continue with my chosen career path of cybersecurity. Global spending on cyber security is expected to almost double between 2016 and 2026 (Department of industry 2018). With this increase in spending comes a large amount of potential career growth as well as potential progression in this industry. New and emerging cybersecurity threats will ensure I am always learning something different every day and will guarantee I continue to enjoy the role. Job security is important to me and as cybersecurity is a growing sector full of opportunities, there will be no need for redundancies to occur, improving job security.</p>

                <h2>Nathan</h2>
                <p>After researching the IT industry, I would still like to work towards my ideal job in game development. With the demand of my job being low but the IT skill required high, I feel like learning these skills will help if ever in the future I would like to change jobs. With the increase of people entering themself with gaming and the industry growing there will be no need to worry about the industry ever being in low demand.</p>

                <h2>Zenithon</h2>
                <p>Looking at the Burning Glass data has not changed my opinion of my ideal job. As a Full Stack Developer, I would be proficient in both the front and back-end programming languages. Based on the national skills commission by the Australian government in June 2021, there is currently no national shortage of web developers and developer programmers, however, there is a strong future demand. It is important to note that as a Full Stack developer, programming languages such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Java are already known to them. For this particular job, programming languages such as Microsoft C#, TypeScript and .NetCore/.NET 5/6 would also be a given. Despite Burning Glass technologies indicating that Full Stack Developer ranks 17th, would not be limited to just working as a Full Stack Developer. In a last resort situation, since I would be proficient in .NET development, Java, as well as the ins and outs of the Front-end developer, I could switch to either of those jobs if required. Looking at the Burning Glass data shows .NET Developer ranking at 3rd, Front End developer at 6th and Java developer at 7th. This opens up multiple possible job options, and I would not be limited to just working as a Full Stack developer, so long as my skills and experience align with the job. Additionally, using the Burning Glass Technologies to show the greatest skills in demand ranks SQL in 1st, followed by JavaScript in 2nd and Microsoft C# in 3rd. All of these languages would be known to a Full Stack developer, and hence, do not change my opinion relating to my ideal job.</p>

                <h2>Brearne</h2>
                <p>After looking at the Burning Glass analytics, I would still like to pursue my dream job of Senior Big Data DevOps Engineer. I am quite surprised there is not more programming involved. I would have thought more programming skills were required, in order to create more programs to automate tasks. I believe I will also need to be mindful that requirements of this job are subject to change. Change may occur due to requirements of the industry, which are ever evolving. However, for now, working within a team and knowing how to use tools (e.g., containerisation tools) is at the forefront (Simplilearn, 2022). I am particularly still interested in pursuing this career as I can work with and provide support to a diverse team on an ongoing basis.</p>
